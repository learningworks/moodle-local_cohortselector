Cohort selector local plugin
===================

Information
-----------

This plugin for Moodle (http://moodle.org/) was developed for Wintec to aid in searching and selecting cohorts to add
as enrolment instances for a particular course. The plugin uses YUI AutoComplete to filter a list based on search 
critera.

This plugin **depends** on the cohort enrolment plugin being enabled. JavaScript must be enabled on the client
web browser.

To install using git, type this command in the root of your Moodle install
    git@gitlab.elearning.ac.nz:mdl-local/moodle-local_cohortselector.git local/cohortselector

Then go to "Adminstration" > "Notifications"
